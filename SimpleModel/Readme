# describe the developed simple model.

There is Main.R program that can predcit the pathway of butterfly considering elevations. 
The program has 6 step. The first one is to set up the functions and work space. 
The second one is to define the parameters needed to run the model. The needed parameters are elevation, landscape unit(X, Y), nindvs, nsetp, and move (the probaility of moving to
higher elevation patch). 
The third and fourth one is to initialize a landscape and the position of individual butterfly. 
The fifth one is to simulate individuals' movement. 
The sixth one is to draw pathways of butterfly. 

To check the same elevations near the position of individuals, I added some code in the MoveIndv.R subroutine file like below code.

    #move to higher elevation
    if(movehigh==1){
      # checking the same elevations near the position.
      if(length(unique(land[(cxpos-1):(cxpos+1), (cypos-1):(cypos+1)]))<8){  
        xpos = sample(c(-1,0,1), 1) + cxpos
        ypos = sample(c(-1,0,1), 1) + cypos
      } else {
        #find highest elevation cell
        highpt = which(land[(cxpos-1):(cxpos+1), (cypos-1):(cypos+1)] == max(land[(cxpos-1):(cxpos+1), (cypos-1):(cypos+1)]), arr.ind = TRUE)
        
        #calculate new position (x and y values)
        if(highpt[1]==1){xpos = cxpos - 1 }
        if(highpt[1]==2){xpos = cxpos }
        if(highpt[1]==3){xpos = cxpos + 1 }
        if(highpt[2]==1){ypos = cypos - 1 }
        if(highpt[2]==2){ypos = cypos }
        if(highpt[2]==3){ypos = cypos + 1 } 
      }

    }

I used the length and unique function to check there is same elevation near the position. 
Although the model select 1 (with probailbity to moving higher elevation), the bufflies should move randomly if there are same elevatio near its position. 

I run the model 3 times with three probability (0.3, 0.5, and, 0.8). Based on the my results, I figured out there is a cryptic corridor emerges.
You can check the figures in the "Output" folder. All 3 cases, they show a cryptic corridor. But when the probability is 0.5, there is a clear cryptic corridor.
